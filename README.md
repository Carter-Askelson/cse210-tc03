Carter Askelson: Hello everyone, my name is Carter Askelson.  I originally hail from Lake Stevens, Washington in the United States.  Ever since I got home from my Mission I've been incredibly passionate about Coding.  I used Cory Althoff's The Self-Taught Programmer to learn Python.  After a year of Coding I was able to release my first game on Itch.io using the Godot Engine.  I'm super excited to get into learning Classes and Object-Oriented Programming so I can level up my coding knowledge and help me make my 2nd game better than the last.

Graham Walker: My name is Graham Walker. I am from Dallas, TX. I got into programming when I was a financial analyst for 7-Eleven corporate and wanted to be able to automate tasks in excel. I learned a little VBA to help me accomplish what I wanted to do and I thought there has to be more powerful porgramming languages. After that I found Java and got hooked into the world of computer science. I got a new job as a Software Engineer about 3 years and have been loving it ever since. I am excited to learn Python and get refresher on Object-Oriented Programming.
